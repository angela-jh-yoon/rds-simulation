  ### build zero adjacency matrix that will be updated to output G_R

  G_R <- matrix(rep(0,size^2),size)
  
  ### build zero matrix to keep track of waiting time
  T <- matrix(rep(NA,size^2),size)
  
  ### create empty vector to keep track of order of recruitment
  order <- c()
  
  ### initialize i
  i <- start_index
  
  ### iterate until we recruit n-1 more people
  for (x in 1:(n-1)) {
    
    ### from original network, find all vertices adjacent to our most recently recruited vertex
    for (j in 1:size) {
      if (G[i,j] == 1) {

    ### identify the indexes of the recruiter and recruitee of this new recruitment
    recruiter <- new[1,1]

    ### update G_R and order to reflect this new recruitment
    G_R[recruiter,recruitee] <- 1
    order <- append(order,recruitee)
    
    ### update T by subtracting minimum waiting time from all other waiting times
    ### also deactivate all edges from any other vertex to recruitee

    ### note: is there a need to do both? simplify if possible
